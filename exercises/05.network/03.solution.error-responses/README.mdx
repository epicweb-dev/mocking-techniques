# Error responses

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/mocking-techniques-in-vitest/network/error-responses/solution" />

I start with restructuring our project a little bit. In order for me to use runtime handlers, I need to have access to the same `server` object created in `vitest.setup.ts`. However, importing from the setup file _is not recommended_.

> :owl: Although Vitest will **cache imports** and not evaluate the global hooks twice if you import from the setup file, it caches imports **per test file**. This works nice in the isolated mode, which Vitest uses by default, but may cause problems if you switch to parallel test runs.

```shell
/
  /mocks
    handlers.ts # Request handlers for happy paths.
    node.ts # Node.js integration point.
  get-auth-token.test.ts # import { server } from '...'
  vitest.setup.ts # import { server } from '...'
```

With these changes, I can reuse the same `server` object from `./mocks/node.ts` in both `vitest.setup.ts` and in the test suite as well.

```ts filename=vitest.setup.ts add=1
import { server } from './mocks/node.js'

beforeAll(() => {
  server.listen({
    onUnhandledRequest: 'error',
  })
})

afterEach(() => {
  server.resetHandlers()
})

afterAll(() => {
  server.close()
})
```

```ts filename=get-auth-token.test.ts add=2
import { http } from 'msw'
import { server } from './mocks/node.js'
import { getAuthToken } from './get-auth-token.js'
```

At last, I can prepend request handlers using the [`server.use()`](https://mswjs.io/docs/api/setup-server/use) API to model network scenarios on a per-test basis! The workflow for overriding the network will be the same no matter where I'm going to use it:

1. Go to the test case that needs a different network behavior;
1. Call `server.use()` with a request handler for the same request but describe a different mocked response;
1. Execute the tested code (the code that does the request).

Here's how the invalid credentials scenario will look like with the runtuime handler in place:

```ts filename=get-auth-token.test.ts nonumber add=2-6
test('throws an error if the user credentials are invalid', async () => {
  server.use(
    http.post('https://api.example.com/auth', () => {
      return new Response(null, { status: 401 })
    }),
  )

  await expect(() =>
    getAuthToken({
      email: 'kody@epicweb.dev',
      password: 'supersecret123',
    }),
  ).rejects.toThrow('Authentication failed: invalid credentials')
})
```

> `server.use()` **prepends** request handlers so they take higher priority. The prepended handlers will persist until `server.resetHandlers()` function is called, which in our case is called in the `afterEach()` hook in `vitest.setup.ts`.

In a similar fashion, I will create a runtime request handler to emulate a generic 500 server error response in another test case:

```ts filename=get-auth-token.test.ts nonumber add=2-6
test('throws an error if the server responds with an error', async () => {
  server.use(
    http.post('https://api.example.com/auth', () => {
      return new Response(null, { status: 500 })
    }),
  )
```

Lastly, I will run the tests to make sure everything works as expected:

```
 ✓ get-auth-token.test.ts (3)
   ✓ returns the authentication token on successful authentication
   ✓ throws an error if the user credentials are invalid
   ✓ throws an error if the server responds with an error
```

## Further reading

Runtime request handlers is a powerful way to describe dynamic network behaviors. I highly recommend you to read the :scroll: [Network behavior overrides](https://mswjs.io/docs/best-practices/network-behavior-overrides) best practice to learn more how you can utilize it during developing and testing your projects.
