# Error responses

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/mocking-techniques-in-vitest/network/error-responses/solution" />

I start with restructuring our project a little bit. In order for me to use runtime handlers, I need to have access to the same `server` object created in `vitest.setup.ts`. However, importing from the setup file _is not recommended_.

> :owl: Although Vitest will **cache imports** and not evaluate the global hooks twice if you import from the setup file, it caches imports **per test file**. This works nice in the isolated mode, which Vitest uses by default, but may cause problems if you switch to parallel test runs.

```shell
/
  /mocks
    handlers.ts # Request handlers for happy paths.
    node.ts # Node.js integration point.
  get-auth-token.test.ts # import { server } from '...'
  vitest.setup.ts # import { server } from '...'
```

With these changes, I can reuse the same `server` object from `./mocks/node.ts` in both `vite.setup.ts` and in the test suite as well.

<CodeFile file="vitest.setup.ts" highlight="1" />

<CodeFile file="get-auth-token.test.ts" range="1-5" highlight="2" />

At last, I can prepend request handlers using the [`server.use()`](https://mswjs.io/docs/api/setup-server/use) API to model network scenarios on a per-test basis! The workflow for overriding the network will be the same no matter where I'm going to use it:

1. Go to the test case that needs a different network behavior;
1. Call `server.use()` with a request handler for the same request but describe a different mocked response;
1. Execute the tested code (the code that does the request).

Here's how the invalid credentials scenario will look like with the runtuime handler in place:

<CodeFile file="get-auth-token.test.ts" range="14-24" highlight="15-19" />

> `server.use()` **prepends** request handlers so they take higher priority. The prepended handlers will persist until `server.resetHandlers()` function is called, which in our case is called in the `afterEach()` hook in `vitest.setup.ts`.

In a similar fashion, I will create a runtime request handler to emulate a generic 500 server error response in another test case:

<CodeFile file="get-auth-token.test.ts" range="29-34" highlight="30-34" />

Lastly, I will run the tests to make sure everything works as expected:

```
 ✓ get-auth-token.test.ts (3)
   ✓ returns the authentication token on successful authentication
   ✓ throws an error if the user credentials are invalid
   ✓ throws an error if the server responds with an error
```

## Further reading

Runtime request handlers is a powerful way to describe dynamic network behaviors. I highly recommend you to read the :scroll: [Network behavior overrides](https://mswjs.io/docs/best-practices/network-behavior-overrides) best practice to learn more how you can utilize it during developing and testing your projects.
