This concludes the network mocking exercise! :rocket:

Now you know how to intercept requests in your tests and handle their responses. Whether it's responding with mock data or emulating error responses or network errorsâ€”you are in full control over the network when using MSW.

Since MSW builds heavily on the concept of reusability, you can also reuse the very same request handlers for other purposes, like development or debugging. I highly recommend you to explore the library in your free time.
