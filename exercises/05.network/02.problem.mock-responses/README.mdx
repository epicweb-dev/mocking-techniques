# Mock responses

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/mocking-techniques-in-vitest/network/mock-responses" />

Our `getAuthToken()` function significantly depends on the response returned from the server. For starters, there's a validation layer to handle error responses:

```ts filename=get-auth-token.ts nonumber
if (response.status === 401) {
  throw new Error('Authentication failed: invalid credentials')
}

if (!response.ok) {
  throw new Error('Authentication failed: network error')
}
```

Then, there's successful, "happy path" scenario handling, where we read the response body as JSON and return the `token` property from the response body:

```ts filename=get-auth-token.ts nonumber lines=4
const json = await response.json()

return {
  token: json.token,
}
```

And we need to test all of those scenarios!

But let's start from the beginning. Let's start from the happy path.

If the server returns a 200 response, our function will read its body and return some of its properties. _That's_ a great intention to put into a test.

For that intention to happen, the `POST https://api.example.com/auth` request must be (1) intercepted; and (2) mocked. Wait, those two steps are precisely what _request handlers_ are for!

üë®‚Äçüíº In this exercise, create a new request handler in `handlers.ts` for the request made by the `getAuthToken()` function. Respond to that request with a mocked JSON response containing `{ token: 'abc-123' }` in its body. And, finally, finish the test at <InlineFile file="get-auth-token.test.ts" /> to validate the `getAuthToken()` function returns the right `token` from the received response. Verify your solution by running `npm test`.
