# Set up MSW

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/mocking-techniques-in-vitest/network/set-up-msw/solution" />

With MSW set up, we can now run `npm test` and see the outgoing request's method and URL printed during the test run:

```txt highlight=7
$ npm test

> test
> vitest

stdout | get-auth-token.test.ts > returns the authentication token on successful authentication
POST https://api.example.com/auth

 ❯ get-auth-token.test.ts (1)
   × returns the authentication token on successful authentication
```

This confirms that MSW can intercept the request made in `getAuthToken()`. But the test itself is still failing!

```
Caused by: Error: getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND api.example.com
```

Although the error is caused by requesting a non-existent URL, the real issue is that we're still **allowing the test to make the actual request**.

> That's right, **MSW operates in pass-through mode by default**, allowing all intercepted requests to proceed unless instructed otherwise.

It is time for us to change that by mocking the request with MSW!
