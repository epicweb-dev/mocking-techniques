# Global values

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/mocking-techniques-in-vitest/globals/global-values" />

`vi.spyOn()` is a great way to mock and control global methods. However, when your code depends on global _values_, you need to employ a different approach.

In this exercise, we are testing the `toAbsoluteUrl()` function that looks like this:

```ts filename=to-absolute-url.ts
/**
 * Returns absolute URL from the given URL.
 */
export function toAbsoluteUrl(url: string): string {
  return new URL(url, location.href).href
}
```

This is a browser-only function whose purpose is to ensure the `url` we provided to it is returned as an absolute URL. If the `url` is absolute already, it's returned as-is. But if it is a relative URL (i.e. a pathname), it must be resolved against the current `location.href`.

Because of the dependency on `location`, we will be testing the `toAbsoluteUrl()` function in the `happy-dom` environment, which polyfills the global `location` object.

```ts filename=vitest.config.ts lines=6
import { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config'

export default defineConfig({
  test: {
    globals: true,
    environment: 'happy-dom',
  },
})
```

By default, `location.href` in HappyDOM is set to `http://localhost:3000/`. However, for our new test to comply with the [Golden Rule of Assertions](https://www.epicweb.dev/the-golden-rule-of-assertions), the value of the `location.href` must be set on the test's level. Otherwise, a change in Vitest configuration could result in different absolute URLs being produced, thus failing the test prematurely.

Moreover, bringing the actual `location.href` value to the test level will give us more control over different URL-related scenarios (e.g. IPv4 vs IPv6 URLs).

**For that, we are going to use the [`vi.stubGlobal()`](https://vitest.dev/api/vi.html#vi-stubglobal) utility**.

üë®‚Äçüíº In this exercise, use the `vi.stubGlobal` API to mock the value of the global `location` object in the <InlineFile file="to-absolute-url.test.ts" /> test suite. Verify your solution by running `npm test`.

> ü¶â Note that `location` inherits from `URL`, which means it can be partially mocked by using a `URL` instance as its value.
