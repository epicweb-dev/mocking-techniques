# Environment variables

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/mocking-techniques-in-vitest/globals/environment-variables" />

Another kind of global dependency your code may have is on the environment. This is often done via _environment variables_, which, in JavaScript, are often exposed to the process via the `process.env` object.

You use environment variables for tasks like managing API secrets, feature flags, or implementing environment-specific logic. Consequently, environment variables are another dependency you need to know how to mock to properly orchestrate your tests.

One of the most common usages of environment variables is the dependency on the current process' environment, i.e. `process.env.NODE_ENV`. That's precisely what our `Emitter` class does to imbue its methods with logging capabilities if run in development:

```ts filename=emitter.ts nonumber lines=12-14,28-34
function isDevelopment() {
  return process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'
}

export class Emitter<EventMap extends Record<string, Array<unknown>>> {
  // ...

  public on<Event extends keyof EventMap>(
    event: Event,
    listener: (...args: EventMap[Event]) => void,
  ): this {
    if (isDevelopment()) {
      console.log(`adding listener for "${event.toString()}" event`)
    }

    const prevListeners = this.listeners.get(event) || []
    const nextListeners = prevListeners.concat(listener)
    this.listeners.set(event, nextListeners)
    return this
  }

  public emit<Event extends keyof EventMap>(
    event: Event,
    ...data: EventMap[Event]
  ): boolean {
    const listeners = this.listeners.get(event) || []

    if (isDevelopment()) {
      console.log(
        `emitting listeners for "${event.toString()}" event (${
          listeners.length
        })`,
      )
    }

    for (const listener of listeners) {
      listener.apply(this, data)
    }
    return listeners.length > 0
  }
}
```

First, it determines the environment on runtime via the `isDevelopment()` function, and then implements additional logic in the `.on()` and `.emit()` methods of the `Emitter` based on result of the `isDevelopment()` function call.

But how do you test this?

You can, of course, set a different `NODE_ENV` environment variable when running the test script itself:

```sh
NODE_ENV=development npm test
```

But this won't play nicely on different operating systems, and will affect _the entire test run_ instead of focusing on a single test suite. The worst part is that you won‚Äôt be able to change the `NODE_ENV` value only for specific test cases to see how your code behaves.

Alternatively, you can mock `process.env.NODE_ENV` as a _global value_, like you did in the previous exercise. That would work, but you would have to remember to forward all existing environment variables on `process.env` before mocking your own variables. This can easily be forgotten, leading to unreliable or even broken tests.

**You can use [`vi.stubEnv()`](https://vitest.dev/api/vi.html#vi-stubenv)**!

üë®‚Äçüíº The time has come for you to get to know `vi.stubEnv()`. In this exercise, add new test cases for the <InlineFile file="emitter.test.ts" /> test suite by mocking the value of `process.env.NODE_ENV` using the built-in Vitest `vi.stubEnv()` API. Verify your solution by running `npm test`. And remember, you will be asserting on `console.log` calls too!
