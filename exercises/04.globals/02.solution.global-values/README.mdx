# Global values

As it often does, the test begins from the setup. In this case, the setup includes the introduction of both `beforeAll` and `afterAll` hooks to the test suite.

<CodeFile file="to-absolute-url.test.ts" range="3-5" highlight="4" />

In the `beforeAll()` hook, I'm using the `vi.stubGlobal()` function to replace the value of the global property `location` with a mocked `URL` instance. I intentionally provide a mock URL with a path (`/base/`) to make sure that the `toAbsoluteUrl()` function handles relative paths correctly.

And, of course, I am making sure that the global `location` object is unstubbed by calling `vi.unstubAllGlobals()` in the `afterAll()` hook.

<CodeFile file="to-absolute-url.test.ts" range="7-9" highlight="8" />

Now, to the test cases!

The first one is about the scenario where an absolute URL provided to the tested function is returned as-is. That's precisely what I will do:

<CodeFile file="to-absolute-url.test.ts" range="11-13" highlight="12" />

The next scenario involves handling relative URLs that only include paths. In itself, it can be split into two use cases:

- When an _absolute_ path is provided (e.g. `/abc`);
- When a _relative_ path is provided (e.g. `./abc`; notice the dot `.`).

While both being rebased against the mocked `location.href`, these two scenarios will yield different URLs, which I make sure to cover in tests:

<CodeFile file="to-absolute-url.test.ts" range="15-18" highlight="16-17" />

By mocking the value of `location` in this test suite, I have isolated it. Everything that affects the test results of the `toAbsoluteUrl()` function is now contained within this single test file.
