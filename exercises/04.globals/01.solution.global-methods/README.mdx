# Global methods

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/mocking-techniques-in-vitest/globals/global-methods/solution" />

I start by going to the `beforeAll()` hook and adding a spy on the `console.log` method using the `vi.spyOn()` utility:

```ts filename=print-server-url.test.ts nonumber lines=2
beforeAll(() => {
  vi.spyOn(console, 'log').mockImplementation(() => {})
})
```

I'm overriding the implementation of `console.log` for this test suite by using `.mockImplementation()` and providing it an empty function. With this, I can still assert on the `console.log` calls without it actually printing anything to the terminal output.

From this moment forward, all `console.log` calls are recorded and I can assert on them in any test!

Next, I need to reset the recorded state of the spy function for each test run. I will use `vi.resetAllMocks()` for that:

```ts filename=print-server-url.test.ts nonumber lines=2
afterEach(() => {
  vi.resetAllMocks()
})
```

> `vi.resetAllMocks()` targets _all_ mocks created in this test suite, not just the spy for `console.log`. Instead of resetting an individual spy, I prefer resetting all mocks because none of them should leak their state to irrelevant tests.

And, finally, restore the original implementation of `console.log` once the tests are done:

```ts filename=print-server-url.test.ts nonumber lines=2
afterAll(() => {
  vi.restoreAllMocks()
})
```

This concludes the testing setup changes but we still have some assertions to adjust.

Since I am spying on a global method, I can write assertions on that global method directly:

```ts filename=print-server-url.test.ts nonumber lines=1,4
expect(console.log).toHaveBeenCalledWith(
  'Sever is listening at http://127.0.0.1/',
)
expect(console.log).toHaveBeenCalledOnce()
```

```ts filename=print-server-url.test.ts nonumber lines=1,4
expect(console.log).toHaveBeenCalledWith(
  'Sever is listening at http://127.0.0.1:5639/',
)
expect(console.log).toHaveBeenCalledOnce()
```

The only thing remaining is to run the tests and make sure they are passing:

```
 ✓ print-server-url.test.ts (2)
   ✓ prints the server message for url with host and no port
   ✓ prints the server message for url with host and port
```

## Bonus: Type-safe global spies

Although Vitest reassigns the value of `console.log` to a spy function on runtime, TypeScript doesn't know about that. In fact, if you attempt to read some of the spy function's properties, you'll be greeted with a type error:

```ts nonumber
console.log.mock.calls
// Property 'mock' does not exist on type '...'
```

To fix this, you need to extend the type of `Console['log']` in your test and mark it as a mock instance.

```ts
import { MockInstance } from 'vitest'

declare namespace console {
  var log: Console['log'] &
    MockInstance<Parameters<Console['log']>, ReturnType<Console['log']>>
}
```

```ts nonumber
console.log.mock.calls
// [["Server is listening at http://localhost:5639/"]]
```

The way you extend the global type will depend on the declaration for that type. The type of `console.log` happened to be declared in a global namespace `console` so that's the namespace we extend above. Inspect the type declaration of the global you want to extend to ensure it's done correctly.
