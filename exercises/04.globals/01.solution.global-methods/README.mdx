# Global methods

I start by going to the `beforeAll()` hook and adding a spy on the `console.log` method using the `vi.spyOn()` utility:

<CodeFile file="print-server-url.test.ts" range="3-5" />

I'm overriding the implementation of `console.log` for this test suite by using `.mockImplementation()` and providing it an empty function. With this, I can still assert on the `console.log` calls without it actually printing anything to the terminal output.

From this moment forward, all `console.log` calls are recorded and I can assert on them in any test!

Next, I need to make sure that the recorded state of spy function is reset between the tests. I will use `vi.resetAllMocks()` for that:

<CodeFile file="print-server-url.test.ts" range="7-9" />

> `vi.resetAllMocks()` targets _all_ mocks created in this test suite, not just the spy for `console.log`. Instead of resetting an individual spy, I prefer resetting all mocks because none of them should leak their state to irrelevant tests.

And, finally, restore the original implementation of `console.log` once the tests are done:

<CodeFile file="print-server-url.test.ts" range="11-13" />

This concludes the testing setup changes but we still have some assertions to adjust.

Since I am spying on the global method, I can write assertions on that global method directly:

<CodeFile
  file="print-server-url.test.ts"
  range="18-21,27-30"
  highlight="18,21,27,30"
/>

The only thing remaining is to run the tests and make sure they are passing:

```
 ✓ print-server-url.test.ts (2)
   ✓ prints the server message for url with host and no port
   ✓ prints the server message for url with host and port
```

## Bonus: Type-safe global spies

Although Vitest reassigns the value of `console.log` to a spy function on runtime, TypeScript doesn't know about that. In fact, if you attempt to read some of the spy function's properties, you'll be greeted with a type error:

```ts
console.log.mock.calls
// Property 'mock' does not exist on type '...'
```

To fix this, you need to extend the type of `Console['log']` in your test and mark it as a mock instance.

```ts
import { MockInstance } from 'vitest'

declare namespace console {
  var log: Console['log'] &
    MockInstance<Parameters<Console['log']>, ReturnType<Console['log']>>
}
```

```ts
console.log.mock.calls
// [["Server is listening at http://localhost:5639/"]]
```

The way you extend the global type will depend on the declaration for that type. The type of `console.log` happened to be declared in a global namespace `console` so that's the namespace we extend above. Inspect the type declaration of the global you wish to extend to know how to properly do so.
