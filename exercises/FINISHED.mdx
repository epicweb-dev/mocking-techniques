Woohoo! :tada: You've finished the workshop and have now officially become a mocking ninja ðŸ¥·. The techniques you've learned today will serve you well for the long years of testing to come.

But true power only comes with wisdom. Practice, learn, and hone your skills to perfection in your next test suite. You now have the building blocks, but itâ€™s up to you to put them together, combine them, and experiment to create a great testing experience in your next project.

And remember, it should never be about "_What mocking technique should I use?_" but always about "_What do I want this test to focus on?_"

Stay safe and write good tests! :wave:
