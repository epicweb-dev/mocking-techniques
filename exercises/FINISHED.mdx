# Mocking Techniques

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/mocking-techniques-in-vitest/workshop-outro/mocking-techniques-in-vitest-outro" />

Yoohoo! :tada: You've finished the workshop and have now officially become a mocking ninja ðŸ¥·. The techniques you've learned today will serve you well for the long years of testing to come.

But the true power only comes with wisdom. Practice, learn, and hone your skills to perfection in that next test suite. What you have now are the building blocks, but it will be up to you to put them together, combine and experiment, to build a great testing experience at your next project.

And remember, it should never be about "_What mocking technique should I use?_" and always about "_What do I want this test to focus on?_"

Stay safe and write good tests! :wave:
