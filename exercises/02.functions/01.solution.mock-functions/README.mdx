# Mock functions

In the `emitter.test.ts`, I will start from creating the `listener` function but it won't be a regular JavaScript function. Instead, I will use the `vi.fn()` API from Vitest, which creates a _special_ kind of function.

```ts filename=emitter.test.ts nonumber
const listener = vi.fn()
```

> ðŸ“œ Learn more about [`vi.fn()`](https://vitest.dev/api/vi.html#vi-fn) from the Vitest documentation.

Calling `vi.fn()` returns a function imbued with superpowers, one of which is the ability to know when and how it is being called!

> Note that for this test, I will create an _empty_ mock function because what the listener itself does is irrelevant to the point of the test (asserting that it has been called).

Now that the mock function is ready, I will use it as a listener argument for the `hello` event:

```ts filename=emitter.test.ts nonumber
emitter.on('hello', listener)
```

Everything up to this point was the setup for this test. The action here would be calling the `.emit()` method to emit the `hello` event because the listeners are only called when the respective event gets emitted.

```ts filename=emitter.test.ts nonumber
emitter.emit('hello', 'John')
```

I expect two things to happen once the `hello` event is emitted:

1. The `listener` function gets called, and gets called _once_;
1. The `listener` function gets called with the right dataâ€”the `'John'` string.

The `expect()` function from Vitest comes with handy assertions to describe both of those expectations!

First, I will use the `.toHaveBeenCalledOnce()` assertion:

```ts filename=emitter.test.ts nonumber
expect(listener).toHaveBeenCalledOnce()
```

This will only pass if the `listener` function has been called exactly once. If it gets called any other number of times, it's a bug, and the test will fail.

In the same fashion, I will apply the [`.toHaveBeenCalledWith()`](https://vitest.dev/api/expect.html#tohavebeencalledwith) assertion to check that the `listener` function gets called with the right data:

```ts filename=emitter.test.ts nonumber
expect(listener).toHaveBeenCalledWith('John')
```
