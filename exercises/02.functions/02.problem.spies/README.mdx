Testing the intentions around side effects is always tricky. Like this `UserService` class that's supposed to log out the `createUser` event whenever a new user is created:

```ts filename=user-service.ts nocopy lines=7
import { Logger } from './logger.js'

export class UserService {
  constructor(private logger: Logger) {}

  public async createUser(initialState: { id: string; name: string }) {
    this.logger.log('createUser', { id: initialState.id })

    if (!/^\w{3}-\d{3}$/.test(initialState.id)) {
      throw new Error(
        `Failed to create a user: incorrect ID ("${initialState.id}")`,
      )
    }

    return initialState
  }
}
```

To make things more complicated, logging out the event is not the responsibility of the `UserService` class. Instead, it relies on the `Logger` class and its `.log()` method to do that. So while the actual logging logic is irrelevant in the context of `UserService`, we still have to test the intention of it _calling_ `logger.log()` with the correct arguments.

Luckily, the class accepts a `logger` instance as an argument:

```ts filename=user-service.ts nocopy
constructor(private logger: Logger) {}
```

This means we can use a _dependency injection_ to provide it with whichever logger instance we want in test. For example, a logger that we will 🕵️ _spy on_.

_Spying_ is a technique to record a function's execution. It's like pressing a record button on a radio to listen to any function calls while it's being used. Spies give us access to the information like the number of function calls, the exact arguments provided, and values returned. Spies also allow us to completely override the behavior of any function, if we want to.

You will use both recording and overriding in this exercise.

👨‍💼 Complete the <InlineFile file="user-service.test.ts" /> test suite by spying on `logger.log()`. Add the assertions on the expected spy calls and make sure that the test is passing with `npm test`.
