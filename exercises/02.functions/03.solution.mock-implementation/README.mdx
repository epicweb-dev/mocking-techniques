# Mock implementation

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/mocking-techniques-in-vitest/functions/mock-implementation/solution" />

Let's start by going to the first test case for our `OrderController` and spying on the `isItemInStock` method of the created `controller` instance:

```ts filename=order-controller.test.ts nonumber lines=4
test('creates an order when all items are in stock', () => {
  const controller = new OrderController()

  vi.spyOn(controller, 'isItemInStock').mockReturnValue(true)
```

<callout-info>Since the object I'm spying on (`controller`) is scoped to this particular test, there's no need to introduce any test setup to reset the mock.</callout-info>

By using [`.mockReturnValue()`](https://vitest.dev/api/mock.html#mockreturnvalue), I am forcing the `.isItemInStock()` method to always return true when run in this test. With that behavior fixed, I can write the assertions around how the new order should be created:

```ts filename=order-controller.test.ts nonumber lines=15-23
test('creates an order when all items are in stock', () => {
  const controller = new OrderController()

  vi.spyOn(controller, 'isItemInStock').mockReturnValue(true)

  const cart: Cart = [
    {
      id: 4,
      name: 'Porcelain vase',
      quantity: 1,
    },
  ]
  const order = controller.createOrder({ cart })

  expect(order).toEqual<Order>({
    cart: [
      {
        id: 4,
        name: 'Porcelain vase',
        quantity: 1,
      },
    ],
  })
})
```

> I prefer keeping my assertions explicit so I _repeat_ the entire `cart` object within my `expect()` statement.

In the next test case, I'd like to do things a little differently. I will still spy on the `.isItemInStock()` method, but instead of mocking its return value, I will _mock that method's implementation_.

```ts filename=order-controller.test.ts nonumber lines=4-6
test('throws an error when one of the items is out of stock', () => {
  const controller = new OrderController()

  vi.spyOn(controller, 'isItemInStock').mockImplementation((item) => {
    return item.id === 4
  })
```

By mocking the implementation, I am creating a mock with conditional behavior. It will behave differently based on the cart `item` that's being checked. Only the item with `id` that equals `4` will be considered in stock. This way, I am able to reproduce the error throwing logic as well as assert on the `controller` class including the right item IDs in the error message.

```ts filename=order-controller.test.ts nonumber lines=26-28
test('throws an error when one of the items is out of stock', () => {
  const controller = new OrderController()

  vi.spyOn(controller, 'isItemInStock').mockImplementation((item) => {
    return item.id === 4
  })

  const cart: Cart = [
    {
      id: 4,
      name: 'Porcelain vase',
      quantity: 1,
    },
    {
      id: 5,
      name: 'Sofa',
      quantity: 3,
    },
    {
      id: 6,
      name: 'Microwave',
      quantity: 1,
    },
  ]

  expect(() => controller.createOrder({ cart })).toThrowError(
    'Failed to create an order: found out of stock items (5, 6)',
  )
})
```

## Alternative approach

Because we are mocking the `.isItemInStock()` method entirely in this test, we focus our the logic of the `.createOrder()` method of the `OrderController` class. That is where we are establishing the test boundary.

Alternatively, we could also mock the dependency on `stock.json` to decide which items are in stock on the data level. Notice how that would've yielded a different test that would also include the functionality of the `.isItemInStock()` method (the filtering). You will learn more about module mocking later in this workshop.
