# Spies

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/mocking-techniques-in-vitest/functions/spies/solution" />

Let's start by creating a _spy_ for the `logger.log()` method using the [`vi.spyOn()`](https://vitest.dev/api/vi.html#vi-spyon) function from Vitest:

```ts filename=user-service.test.ts nonumber lines=2
const logger = new Logger()
vi.spyOn(logger, 'log')
const service = new UserService(logger)
```

The `spyOn()` function has a bit of unusual call signature since it _will not_ accept the `logger.log` method reference directly. Instead, it expects the object that owns the method first, and then the method name as a string:

```ts nonumber
vi.spyOn(target, method)
```

> :owl: The reason behind this call signature is how `.spyOn()` works under the hood. It redefines the `method` on the `target` object with a spied version of that method! You can think of it as `target[method] = methodSpy`.

Now that I have the spy ready and recording, I can write an assertion on that method being called with the correct arguments using the [`.toHaveBeenCalledWith()`](https://vitest.dev/api/expect.html#tohavebeencalledwith) assertion:

```ts filename=user-service.test.ts nonumber
expect(logger.log).toHaveBeenCalledWith('createUser', { id: 'abc-123' })
```

Finally, I will make sure that `logger.log()` has been called exactly once:

```ts filename=user-service.test.ts nonumber
expect(logger.log).toHaveBeenCalledOnce()
```

To validate the test, I will run `npm test`:

```
 ✓ user-service.test.ts (1)
   ✓ logs out the "createUser" event when creating a new user
```
