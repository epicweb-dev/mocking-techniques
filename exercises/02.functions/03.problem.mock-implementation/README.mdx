# Mock implementation

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/mocking-techniques-in-vitest/functions/mock-implementation" />

In this one, we have an `OrderController` class responsible for handling orders in our eshop. It has a `.createOrder()` method that accepts a `cart` object and does the following:

1. Throws an error if any of the cart items are out of stock;
1. Otherwise, creates a new order object and returns it.

The `.createOrder()` method relies on another `.isItemInStock()` method of the same class to check any given cart item's availability.

```ts filename=order-controller.ts nocopy lines=2-4
  public createOrder(args: { cart: Cart }): Order {
    const itemsOutOfStock = args.cart.filter(
      (item) => !this.isItemInStock(item),
    )

    if (itemsOutOfStock.length > 0) {
      const outOfSocketItemIds = itemsOutOfStock.map((item) => item.id)
      throw new Error(
        `Failed to create an order: found out of stock items (${outOfSocketItemIds.join(
          ', ',
        )})`,
      )
    }

    return {
      cart: args.cart,
    }
  }
```

The data for the item availability itself comes from the `stock.json` file that 👨‍💼 Peter the Project Manager does a faithful job of updating on a daily basis (think of this JSON file as any source of data—e.g. a database).

```ts filename=order-controller.ts nocopy lines=7
import stockJson from './stock.json'

export class OrderController {
  // ...

  public isItemInStock(item: CartItem): boolean {
    const itemInStock = stockJson.items.find((existingItem) => {
      return existingItem.id === item.id
    })

    return itemInStock && itemInStock.quantity >= item.quantity
  }
}
```

That's the responsibility Peter bestowed upon himself.

Your responsibility, however, is to test the `.createOrder()` method on **the** `controller` class. There are couple of ways you can use mocking to help you with that, especially when it comes to modeling different item availability states.

👨‍💼 Write automated tests for _both_ of the expectations toward the `.createOrder()` method by using [`.mockReturnValue()`](https://vitest.dev/api/mock.html#mockreturnvalue) and [`.mockImplementation()`](https://vitest.dev/api/mock.html#mockimplementation) utilities in Vitest to control the behavior of the `.isItemInStock()` method. By the end of the exercise, `npm test` must pass!
