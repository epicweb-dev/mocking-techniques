# Timers

[Debounce and throttle](https://kettanaito.com/blog/debounce-vs-throttle) have to be some of my favorite utility functions, and they both happened to rely on timers to work. Let's study them in more detail and also see how we would test them.

Take a look at the `debounce` function implementation below:

<CodeFile file="debounce.ts" />

The intention behind the `debounce()` function is to accept a `callback` and keep delaying its execution until a certain time `duration` has passed since its last call.

For example, consider this usage scenario:

```ts
// Create a debounced function of "foo"
// with the debounce duration of 250ms.
const bar = debounce(foo, 250)
bar('one')
bar('two')
bar('three')
```

Here, the `bar()` function is just a debounced wrapped over `foo()`. Not all calls to `bar()` will translate to the calls of `foo()` (hence, the whole point of debouncing). Here's what's happening in the example above:

- `bar('one')` gets called, starting a 250ms timer for `foo('one')`.
- `bar('two')` gets called, cancelling the previous timer and starting a new one for `foo('two')`.
- `bar('three')` gets called, cancelling the previous timer and starting a new one for `foo('three')`.
- After 250ms pass without any calls to `bar()`, the `foo('three')` finally gets called.

Let's try putting this very use case into an automated test:

```ts filename=debounce.test.ts
test('executes the callback after the debounce timeout', () => {
  const foo = vi.fn<(input: string) => void>()
  const bar = debounce(foo, 250)

  bar('one')
  bar('two')
  bar('three')

  expect(foo).toHaveBeenCalledOnce()
  expect(foo).toHaveBeenCalledWith('three')
})
```

Running this test, however, will produce something _unexpected_:

```txt highlight=6
 FAIL  debounce.test.ts > executes the callback after the debounce timeout
AssertionError: expected "spy" to be called once, but got 0 times
 ❯ debounce.test.ts:19:15
     7|   bar('three')
     8|
     9|   expect(foo).toHaveBeenCalledOnce()
```

The `foo()` function is not called at all!

Our assertions throw because they run _immediately_ after the debounced calls. We aren't taking the debounce timeout (250ms) into account at all. I think it's time we did.

You already know how to mock date and time using the `vi.useFakeTimers()` and `vi.setSystemTime()` methods, but this exercise doesn't just require you to mock them, it requires you to _advance_ the time.

👨‍💼 Complete the test suite for <InlineFile file="debounce.test.ts" /> by handling the `setTimeout()` in test and having the scenarios pass by running `npm test`.
