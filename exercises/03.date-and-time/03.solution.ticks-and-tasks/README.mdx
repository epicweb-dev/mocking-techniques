# Ticks and tasks

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/mocking-techniques-in-vitest/date-and-time/ticks-and-tasks/solution" />

The first thing to mention is that by default `vi.useFakeTimers()` does _not_ mock `queueMicrotask()`. To enable that, I will provide it with the `toFake` argument configured to include `'queueMicrotask'` in the timer mocks:

```ts filename=connection.test.ts nonumber lines=2-4
beforeAll(() => {
  vi.useFakeTimers({
    toFake: ['queueMicrotask'],
  })
})

afterAll(() => {
  vi.useRealTimers()
})
```

Next, I will create a mock `connectionListener` function to be able to spy on it:

```ts filename=connection.test.ts nonumber lines=2
test('dispatches the "connection" event', () => {
  const connectionListener = vi.fn()
```

I will use the `connectionListener` function to add a new event listener on the `connection` instance:

```ts filename=connection.test.ts nonumber lines=2
const connection = new Connection()
connection.addEventListener('connection', connectionListener)
```

Writing the call assertion for the `connectionListener` now will fail, since the scheduled dispatch hasn't run yet. To make it run, I will ask Vitest to exhaust the entire execution stack using the [`vi.runAllTicks()`](https://vitest.dev/api/vi.html#vi-runallticks) function:

```ts filename=connection.test.ts nonumber
vi.runAllTicks()
```

> Note that this is a <u>synchronous</u> function!

Finally, I will add an assertion that the `connectionListener` has been called once:

```ts filename=connection.test.ts nonumber
expect(connectionListener).toHaveBeenCalledOnce()
```
