# Ticks and tasks

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/mocking-techniques-in-vitest/date-and-time/ticks-and-tasks/solution" />

First thing to mention is that the usual `vi.useFakeTimers()` does _not_ mock `queueMicrotask()`. To enable that, I will provide it with the `toFake` argument configured to include `'queueMicrotask'` in the date mocks:

<CodeFile file="connection.test.ts" range="3-11" highlight="4-6" />

Next, I will create a mock `connectionListener` function to be able to spy on it:

<CodeFile file="connection.test.ts" range="13-14" highlight="14" />

I will use the `connectionListener` function to add a new event listener on the `connection` instance:

<CodeFile file="connection.test.ts" range="16-17" highlight="17" />

Writing the call assertion for the `connectionListener` now will fail, since the scheduled dispatch hasn't run yet. To make it run, I will ask Vitest to exhaust the entire execution stack using the [`vi.runAllTicks()`](https://vitest.dev/api/vi.html#vi-runallticks) function:

<CodeFile file="connection.test.ts" range="19" />

> Note that this is a <u>synchronous</u> function!

Finally, I will add the assertion that the `connectionListener` has been called once:

<CodeFile file="connection.test.ts" range="21" />
