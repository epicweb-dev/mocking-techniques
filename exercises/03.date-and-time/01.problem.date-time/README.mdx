# Date and time

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/mocking-techniques-in-vitest/date-and-time/date-and-time" />

In our application, we need to display a relative time label, like "1 minute ago", "3 days ago", etc. We've created a `getRelativeTime()` function to achieve that. It takes any given date and calculates how far ago it was compared to `Date.now()`, returning a formatted string.

```ts filename=get-relative-time.ts
/**
 * Return a relative time string from a given date.
 */
export function getRelativeTime(date: Date): string {
  const delta =
    Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) - Math.floor(date.getTime() / 1000)

  /**
   * Use the standard `Intl.RelativeTimeFormat` API to produce human-friendly relative time strings.
   * @see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/RelativeTimeFormat
   */
  const formatter = new Intl.RelativeTimeFormat('en', { style: 'long' })

  switch (true) {
    case delta < 60: {
      return `Just now`
    }
    case delta < 3600: {
      return formatter.format(-Math.floor(delta / 60), 'minute')
    }
    case delta < 86_400: {
      return formatter.format(-Math.floor(delta / 3600), 'hour')
    }
    case delta < 2_620_800: {
      return formatter.format(-Math.floor(delta / 86_400), 'day')
    }
    case delta < 31_449_600: {
      return formatter.format(-Math.floor(delta / 2_620_800), 'month')
    }
    default: {
      return formatter.format(-Math.floor(delta / 31_449_600), 'year')
    }
  }
}
```

> We are also using the standard [`Intl.RelativeTimeFormat()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/RelativeTimeFormat) API to help us format the time: "1 minute ago" but "5 minute<u>s</u> ago". Give it a read if you're not familiar with it!

By using mocking, we can become magicians who can bend time and space! Well, maybe just time‚Äîfor now. Vitest comes with a built-in [`vi.useFakeTimers()`](https://vitest.dev/api/vi.html#vi-usefaketimers) utility to make otherwise unpredictable date and time fixed and given.

Since mocking time is such a common use case, Vitest gives you a more comfortable API to work with while also allowing to toggle between the "fake" and the "real" date whenever you need.

To reliably test our `getRelativeTime()` function, we have to _freeze the date_ in our test. For example, by setting it to always be the 1st of June 2024:

```ts nonumber
vi.useFakeTimers()
vi.setSystemTime(new Date('2024-06-01 00:00:00.000Z'))

// Any "new Date()" or "Date.now()" calls past this point
// will resolve to the midnight of the 1st of June 2024.
```

But this is, of course, not enough. We don't need a specific date but _different_ days to model relative scenarios (1 minute ago, 2 months ago, etc). Each test will exist in its own separate little universe!

üë®‚Äçüíº Complete the test suite for the `getRelativeTime()` function. Remember that `vi.useFakeTimers()` is still a mock and must be treated as such (cleanup?). Verify your solution by running `npm test`.
