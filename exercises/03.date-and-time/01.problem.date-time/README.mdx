# Date and time

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/mocking-techniques-in-vitest/date-and-time/date-and-time" />

In our application, we need to display a relative time label, like "1 minute ago", "3 days ago", etc. We've created a `getRelativeTime()` function to achieve that. It takes any given date and calculates how far ago it was compared to `Date.now()`, returning a formatted string.

<CodeFile file="get-relative-time.ts" />

> We are also using the standard [`Intl.RelativeTimeFormat()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/RelativeTimeFormat) API to help us format the time: "1 minute ago" but "5 minute<u>s</u> ago". Give it a read if you're not familiar with it!

By using mocking, we can become magicians who can bend time and space! Well, maybe just time, for now. Vitest comes with a built-in [`vi.useFakeTimers()`](https://vitest.dev/api/vi.html#vi-usefaketimers) utility to make otherwise unpredictable date and time fixed and given.

Since mocking time is such a common use case, Vitest gives you a more comfortable API to work with while also allowing to toggle between the "fake" and the "real" date whenever you need.

To reliably test our `getRelativeTime()` function, we have to _freeze the date_ in our test. For example, by setting it to always be the 1st of June 2024:

```ts
vi.useFakeTimers()
vi.setSystemTime(new Date('2024-06-01 00:00:00.000Z'))

// Any "new Date()" or "Date.now()" calls past this point
// will resolve to the midnight of the 1st of June 2024.
```

But this is, of course, not enough. We don't need a specific date but _different_ days to model relative scenarios (1 minute ago, 2 months ago, etc). Loos like each test will exist in its own, separate little universe!

üë®‚Äçüíº Complete the test suite for the `getRelativeTime()` function. Remember that `vi.useFakeTimers()` is still a mock and must be treated as such (cleanup?). Verify your solution by running `npm test`.
