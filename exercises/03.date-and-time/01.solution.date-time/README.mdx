# Date and time

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/mocking-techniques-in-vitest/date-and-time/date-and-time/solution" />

You may be noticing a pattern here. I'm trying to keep mock definitions contained and use the hooks like `beforeAll()` and `afterAll()` to make sure no mocks are left once the tests are done (and, often, even between the tests).

Testing the `getRelativeTime()` function will be no exception:

```ts filename=get-relative-time.test.ts nonumber lines=2,6
beforeAll(() => {
  vi.useFakeTimers()
})

afterAll(() => {
  vi.useRealTimers()
})
```

Calling `vi.useFakeTimers()` detached this test from the real flow of time, and makes it rely on the internal fake date Vitest has. Correspondingly, the `vi.useRealTimers()` utility undoes that.

To fix date and time in test, I will call `vi.setSystemTime()` function and provide it with the date that I want to be treated as `Date.now()`:

```ts filename=get-relative-time.test.ts nonumber lines=2
test('returns "Just now" for the current date', () => {
  vi.setSystemTime(new Date('2024-06-01 00:00:00.000Z'))
```

> :owl: `vi.setSystemTime()` only works in conjunction with `vi.useFakeTimers()`.

In order to model the "Just now" scenario, the delta between the current time and the start time has to be 60 seconds or less. In this test, I will pass the exact same date to the `getRelativeTime()` function as the system time:

```ts filename=get-relative-time.test.ts nonumber
expect(getRelativeTime(new Date('2024-06-01 00:00:00.000Z'))).toBe('Just now')
```

> This produces the time delta of `0ms`, which results in the `"Just now"` string being returned from the function.

For the tests that feature an actual time difference, I have to use a slightly different setup. Firsts, the system time (which is `Date.now()`) should be set to the time that has _already passed_. Then, the `getRelativeTime()` function will accept the _starting time_ as an argument.

```ts filename=get-relative-time.test.ts nonumber lines=2
test('returns "minute ago" for a date a minute ago', () => {
  vi.setSystemTime(new Date('2024-06-01 00:01:05.000Z'))
  expect(getRelativeTime(new Date('2024-06-01 00:00:00.000Z'))).toBe(
    '1 minute ago',
  )
})
```

Above, I'm setting the `1m 5s 0ms` time difference because the system time is exactly that duration ahead of the starting time passed to `getRelativeTime()`.

> 📜 It's worth mentioning that Vitest has a [`vi.advanceTimersByTime()`](https://vitest.dev/api/vi.html#vi-advancetimersbytime) method to help you advance the system time by a given amount in milliseconds. I am intentionally not using that method in this test for two reasons:

1. Working with full dates is more convenient in this case. You can easily tell apart a `1m 5s` difference. Using milliseconds, you'd have to compute that difference in your head every time you read the test.
1. `vi.advanceTimersByTime()` advances the date _in place_. This means that as soon as I call it, the `Date.now()` will shift by the given amount. I would have to store the initial date separately because that's the date that has to be passed to the `getRelativeTime()` function (i.e. the start time).

You are free to explore the <InlineFile file="get-relative-time.test.ts" /> test suite to spot any additional test cases you might have missed to cover the function's behavior.
