# Timers

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/mocking-techniques-in-vitest/date-and-time/timers/solution" />

I begin by setting up the testing hooks to mock time in this test, using the `vi.useFakeTimers()` and `vi.useRealTimers()` functions, the same way I did in the previous exercise:

```ts filename=debounce.test.ts nonumber lines=2,6
beforeAll(() => {
  vi.useFakeTimers()
})

afterAll(() => {
  vi.useRealTimers()
})
```

> Note that mocking date and time includes mocking timers and intervals as well!

My next goal is to call the `debouncedFn()` and make sure that the wrapped `fn` function is _not_ called since the debounce duration has not yet passed.

```ts filename=debounce.test.ts nonumber lines=5-6
test('executes the callback after the debounce timeout passes', () => {
  const fn = vi.fn<(input: string) => void>()
  const debouncedFn = debounce(fn, 250)

  debouncedFn('one')
  expect(fn).not.toHaveBeenCalled()

```

> Since the `debounce()` accepts _any_ function as the argument, I am creating a mock function via `vi.fn()` so I can spy on its calls and assert them! Passing it a type argument of `(input: number) => void` also allows me to define the call signature of that mocked function to keep it type-safe in tests.

Now, let's shift the time!

Vitest provides us with a bunch of utility functions to control timers in test:

- [`vi.advanceTimersByTime()`](https://vitest.dev/api/vi.html#vi-advancetimersbytime)
- [`vi.advanceTimersByTimeAsync()`](https://vitest.dev/api/vi.html#vi-advancetimersbytimeasync)
- [`vi.advanceTimersToNextTimer()`](https://vitest.dev/api/vi.html#vi-advancetimerstonexttimer)
- [`vi.advanceTimersToNextTimerAsync()`](https://vitest.dev/api/vi.html#vi-advancetimerstonexttimerasync)

All of those are great tools to have in your toolbelt. In this test, I will use the `vi.advanceTimersByTime()` function to advance the time in test by 250 milliseconds.

```ts filename=debounce.test.ts nonumber
vi.advanceTimersByTime(250)
```

This will immediately fast-forward the test universe ahead by 250ms, allowing me to write my expectations against the tested debounced function:

```ts filename=debounce.test.ts nonumber lines=3-4
vi.advanceTimersByTime(250)

expect(fn).toHaveBeenCalledOnce()
expect(fn).toHaveBeenCalledWith('one')
```

The second test case will use everything we've learned so far to test repeated calls to the debounced function:

```ts filename=debounce.test.ts nonumber lines=8,13
test('debounces the callback until the timeout passes since the last call', () => {
  const fn = vi.fn<(input: string) => void>()
  const debouncedFn = debounce(fn, 250)

  debouncedFn('one')
  expect(fn).not.toHaveBeenCalled()

  vi.advanceTimersByTime(100)

  debouncedFn('two')
  expect(fn).not.toHaveBeenCalled()

  vi.advanceTimersByTime(250)

  expect(fn).toHaveBeenCalledOnce()
  expect(fn).toHaveBeenCalledWith('two')
})
```

> Note that you can use fake timers and `vi.advanceTimersByTime()` and `vi.advanceTimersToNextTimer()` to test intervals (`setInterval`) too!

## Difference from `sleep()`

You may be wondering about the difference between `vi.advanceTimersByTime()` and something like a `sleep()` function. Since in this case we do need to wait for a fixed period of time to pass, using `sleep()` may seem like a viable alternative. But the two behave completely differently.

The `vi.advanceTimersByTime()` function advances the mocked time _immediately_. You can advance the timers by a year and only a millisecond will pass in your test (this is _not_ an Interstellar reference). It allows you to be in full control over the time in your test, separating the mocked and the real time.

The `sleep()` function, on the other hand, will actually wait for the given time. So if your functionality has a timeout that exceeds your test's timeout, you won't be able to sleep it through. From this perspective, `sleep()` becomes a part of the _action_ in your test, not the setup.

> It's worth mentioning that since `sleep()` often depends on `setTimeout()`, it _won't do anything if you are using fake timers anyway_. You would have to advance the timers for the `sleep()` function as well for it to work.
