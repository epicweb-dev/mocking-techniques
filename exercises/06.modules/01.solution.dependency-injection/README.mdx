# Dependency injection

First, let's complete the `FakeFileStorage` class.

I will create an in-memory store for the files in my `FakeFileStorage` class by defining a private property `data` and making it a `Map`:

```ts filename=upload-service.test.ts nonumber add=2
class FakeFileStorage implements FileStorage {
  private data = new Map<string, Array<ArrayBuffer>>()
}
```

> I'm using `string` as the type argument for the keys stored in the map (i.e. file names), and `Array<ArrayBuffer>` as the value type representing a list of buffer chunks that belong to a single file.

Next, let's implement the `setItem()` method on the fake file storage class. Because I'm using `implements` for the fake class, TypeScript forces my fake class to be _type-compliant_ with the original file storage. But it doesn't have to be _implementation-compliant_.

In fact, I will implement the `setItem()` method by storing the given file in-memory, using the private `data` I've introduced earlier.

```ts filename=upload-service.test.ts nonumber add=4-7
class FakeFileStorage implements FileStorage {
  private data = new Map<string, Array<ArrayBuffer>>()

  public setItem(key: string, value: Array<ArrayBuffer>): Promise<void> {
    this.data.set(key, value)
    return Promise.resolve()
  }
}
```

> I'm using `Map.prototype.set` to store the `value` (the file chunks) by the file's `key`.

Next on the list is the `get()` method of the fake storage object. For this one, since the original `getItem()` method returns a `Promise`, I will wrap my `data` value access in `Promise.resolve()`. This will make my fake method to return a promise that resolves to the result of looking up the file in the `data` map.

```ts filename=upload-service.test.ts nonumber add=9-11
class FakeFileStorage implements FileStorage {
  private data = new Map<string, Array<ArrayBuffer>>()

  public setItem(key: string, value: Array<ArrayBuffer>): Promise<void> {
    this.data.set(key, value)
    return Promise.resolve()
  }

  public getItem(key: string): Promise<Array<ArrayBuffer> | undefined> {
    return Promise.resolve(this.data.get(key))
  }
}
```

With my file storage fake ready, I can use it in tests.

In the first test, I will declare a `store` variable and assign it to be an instance of the `FakeFileStorage` class:

```ts filename=upload-service.test.ts nonumber add=2
test('stores a small file in a single chunk', async () => {
  const storage = new FakeFileStorage()
```

I can then provide the fake `storage` instance as an argument to the `UploadService` constructor to use the fake storage object during the test run:

```ts filename=upload-service.test.ts nonumber add=4
test('stores a small file in a single chunk', async () => {
  const storage = new FakeFileStorage()
  const uploadService = new UploadService({
    storage,
    maxChunkSize: 5,
  })
```

The upload service instance for this test is configured to have `5` bytes as the maximum allowed chunk size:

```ts filename=upload-service.test.ts nonumber lines=3
const uploadService = new UploadService({
  storage,
  maxChunkSize: 5,
})
```

Since I'm uploading a file with the content `'hello'`, and it's _exactly_ 5 bytes long, I am expecting a single chunk to be stored in my fake storage object. Let's write an assertion just for that:

```ts filename=upload-service.test.ts nonumber add=14
test('stores a small file in a single chunk', async () => {
  const storage = new FakeFileStorage()
  const uploadService = new UploadService({
    storage,
    maxChunkSize: 5,
  })

  const storedItem = await uploadService.upload(
    new File(['hello'], 'hello.txt'),
  )

  const chunks = storedItem.map((chunk) => Buffer.from(chunk).toString())

  expect(chunks).toEqual(['hello'])
})
```

> To have a better diff when asserting on buffers (file content), I'm introducing a `chunks` variable that maps all the `storedItem` file chunks to _strings_ just for testing purposes.

But what about uploading larger files?

Jumping to the second test, I will create a fake storage instance as before, and provide it to the `UploadService` constructor.

```ts filename=upload-service.test.ts nonumber add=2,4
test('splits a large file in multiple chunks', async () => {
  const storage = new FakeFileStorage()
  const uploadService = new UploadService({
    storage,
    maxChunkSize: 5,
  })
```

Then, I will upload a larger file, containing `hello-world` as its content.

```ts filename=upload-service.test.ts nonumber
const storedItem = await uploadService.upload(
  new File(['hello-world'], 'hello.txt'),
)
```

Since this file content exceeds the `maxChunkSize` of 5 bytes, I expect _three_ chunks to be uploaded to the fake storage:

- `hello` (first 5 bytes);
- `-worl` (next 5 bytes);
- `d` (the remaining 1 byte).

```ts filename=upload-service.test.ts nonumber add=14
test('splits a large file in multiple chunks', async () => {
  const storage = new FakeFileStorage()
  const uploadService = new UploadService({
    storage,
    maxChunkSize: 5,
  })

  const storedItem = await uploadService.upload(
    new File(['hello-world'], 'hello.txt'),
  )

  const chunks = storedItem.map((chunk) => Buffer.from(chunk).toString())

  expect(chunks).toEqual(['hello', '-worl', 'd'])
})
```

Now, both file upload scenarios for `UploadService` pass in tests because the actual upload functionality is excluded. Instead, it’s delegated to `FakeFileStorage`, which _still stores the uploaded files_, but does so in memory rather than hitting the network.

This excludes the actual `FileStorage` implementation from the test, as it’s irrelevant, while still giving access to the uploaded chunks to reliably assert the behavior of my upload service.
