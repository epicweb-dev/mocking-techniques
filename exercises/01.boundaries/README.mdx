# Boundaries

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/mocking-techniques-in-vitest/boundaries/intro-to-boundaries" />

There has been almost two decades since mocks (originally called "_test doubles_") were first defined. If you go and search for "mocks" online right now, you will find a plethora of technical explanations and usage examples on how to substitute, spy, stub, replace, fake, and do all sorts of things with the tested code. Most of those resources put emphasis on different ways to mock but, somehow, seldom bother to explain what _is_ a mock, _when_ would you reach out for one, and _what_ it actually does to your code.

## What is mocking?

Mocking is a technique to establish :scroll: [_test boundaries_](https://www.epicweb.dev/what-is-a-test-boundary).

Take a look at this `one()` function:

```ts filename=one.ts highlight=3
import { two } from './two.js'

export function one() {
  // Take the number returned from "two()"...
  const result = two()
  // ...and double it.
  return result * 2
}
```

If you write an automated test for this code, it would run both `one()` and `two()` functions during the test:

```ts filename=one.test.ts highlight=4
import { one } from './one.js'

test('doubles what "two" returns', () => {
  expect(one()).toBe(expected)
})
```

This creates an _integration test_ where the connection between `one()` and `two()` is important. This test will fail if `one()` behaves unexpectedly. This test will also fail if `two()` happened to do the same, despite being the test for the `one()` function.

This behavior is neither good nor bad. You are testing the code as-is, and the code has a dependency on another code. If you do nothing about that dependency, you will bring it into the test as well, which is precisely what you want for an integration test!

Sometimes, however, you need to test certain behaviors in isolation. Sometimes, you need to make dependencies behave a certain way to put your tested code in the right state. In those situations, you need to establish a test boundary.

<callout-info class="important">
  A test boundary is a line you draw through the tested code to declare that
  nothing past that line matters.
</callout-info>

Following our previous example, you can define a test boundary by mocking the `two()` function and thus removing the dependency on it from the `one()` test completely.

```ts filename=one.test.ts highlight=5-7
import { one } from './one.js'
import { two } from './two.js'

test('doubles what "two" returns', () => {
  // Mock the "two" function to
  // always return a fixed number.
  mock(two, () => 5)
  expect(one()).toBe(10)
})
```

> The `mock()` API here is a pseudocode. You will learn how to actually mock functions and modules and much more later in this workshop!

By mocking `two()`, you have trimmed down this test to focus on this logic of `one()`:

```ts filename=one.test.ts
return result * 2
//            ^^^
```

Because everything else in `one()` is now _mocked_. The test will no longer fail if `two()` has a bug, only if `one()` fails to do the multiplication correctly.

> You use mocking to preserve the dependency but lift its behavior from the code to the test, making it controllable.

## When do you use mocking?

Mocking in tests can be used for various different reasons:

- To establish the test setup;
- To model particular scenarios;
- To handle (irrelevant) side-effects;
- To model particular behaviors in tests;
- To control and spy on dependencies.

All of the use cases above can be split into either mocking _values_ or mocking _behaviors_. But no matter the purpose, mocking is always about introducing a test boundary (or a few) and reaping its benefits and its drawbacks as well.

While you may hear that mocking should be discouraged in testing, rest assured, it's a tremendously useful tool in your arsenal as long as you know how to wield it.

  It's absolutely crucial you think of mocking as a tool that helps you achieve
  something.
</callout-success>

If you are uncertain whether you should use mocking or not, it may be a good idea to ask yourself some of these questions:

- What exactly does my test do right now?
- When would this test fail? Why?
- Does my tested code depend on anything?
- How does keeping that dependency affect the test?

But also, perhaps the most important question: What does mocking do to my code?

## What mocking does to your code

Mocking is an essential tool for test testing. It can be your lever to transition between different testing levels, handle dependencies, model required behaviors, and focus on particular logic (not to mention various mocking applications outside of the realm of testing!). But beware: when mocking, **you are modifying your code**.

<callout-info class="important">
  The more you alter the system under test, the more you are testing a different
  system.
</callout-info>

Any mock you introduce creates a tiny alternative universe where the code you are testing is mostly the same but not quite. Those "not quite"s can be desired and controllable, but they can also decrease the quality of your tests and make you trust them less. Like any tool, mocking has to be handled with purpose and care.

You don't want to end up in the state where you are running tests against mocks alone. If that happens, you aren't testing anything and should take a good dozen of steps back to reconsider your testing strategy.

In this workshop, we will take a look at the most common applications of mocking and also when and how to use those. But before we begin, let's make sure you get the hang of the concept of a "test boundary" first.
